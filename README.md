# FragmentHelper

This library is suitable for establishing navigation between Fragments in very simple cases. It works, but I don't intend to develop it further because I found [FragNav library](https://github.com/ncapdevi/FragNav). 

[FragNav](https://github.com/ncapdevi/FragNav) follows the same ideology, but is much more mature and feature complete. It also supports multiple Fragments backstacks for bottom tab bar navigation scenario. I recommend using it in production code.
